# What is Metal Band Name Generator?
Metal Band Name Generator (short: MBNG) is a small tool I wrote within 2 school hours (90 minutes) because I was bored and needed something to work on.
While all my class mates learned stuff about CSS font-family I remembered the discussion we had in the break. We asked ourself, why all the metal bands use
similar names. I came up with a generator and it actually works quite well and some names are actually good!

# How does it work?
I made 2 arrays. One with words ("Heaven", "Reaper", "Death" etc.) and one with connectors ("or", "of", "with" etc.). Everytime you click the button those arrays will be smashed together and
I print the name. The syntax for every name is: WORD WORD CONNECTOR WORD. There is a chance of 50% that "the" will be appended to the connector.

# Do you hate metal?
Nope! Not at all. I just found it very funny, that many of the bands a class mate listed as her favorites sounded the same!
